A process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. Each process is identified by a unique number called a process ID (PID)
- `ps` - report a snapshot of the current processes.

- `top` - display Linux processes.
    - periodically displays a sorted list of system processes

- `htop` - interactive process viewer.
    - cross-platform ncurses-based process
    - similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and horizontally, and interact using a pointing device (mouse)
