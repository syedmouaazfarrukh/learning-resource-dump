# SAP HANA Basics For Developers - Database & Tables

# Introduction to SAP HANA Basics For Developers: Part 5.1 Database Content**

In this section, we'll explore the basics of database content management in SAP HANA, focusing on understanding and manipulating data stored within the database.

## Understanding Database Content**

1. **Data Storage:**
   - SAP HANA stores data in tables, which are organized into schemas and catalogs. Tables contain rows and columns, similar to spreadsheets, to store structured data.

2. **Data Types:**
   - SAP HANA supports various data types, including numeric, string, date/time, and spatial data types, allowing for versatile data storage and manipulation.

## Manipulating Data**

1. **Data Insertion:**
   - Inserting data into SAP HANA tables is done using SQL (Structured Query Language) statements such as INSERT INTO. This adds new rows of data to the table.

2. **Data Retrieval:**
   - Retrieving data from SAP HANA tables is accomplished using SELECT statements. Developers can specify criteria to filter and sort the retrieved data as needed.

3. **Data Modification:**
   - Updating existing data in SAP HANA tables is done using UPDATE statements, while deleting data is performed using DELETE statements.

## Database Tools**

1. **SAP HANA Studio:**
   - SAP HANA Studio provides a graphical interface for managing database content, allowing developers to create, edit, and execute SQL queries efficiently.

2. **SQL Console:**
   - The SQL Console within SAP HANA Studio enables developers to interactively execute SQL queries against the database, facilitating data manipulation and analysis.


##  Tables and Views in CAP CDS:**
  - CAP (Cloud Application Programming Model) CDS (Core Data Services) is a framework for defining data models in SAP HANA.
  - It allows developers to define tables and views using CDS syntax, which is a declarative approach to data modeling.
  - Tables represent structured data entities with defined fields and data types, similar to database tables in traditional systems.
  - Views are virtual representations of data that can combine fields from multiple tables or perform calculations on existing data.
  - CAP CDS provides a unified way to define both tables and views, simplifying data modeling and access in SAP HANA applications.

##  Benefits of Tables and Views via CAP CDS:**
  - Simplified Data Modeling: CAP CDS abstracts the complexities of underlying database structures, making it easier for developers to define and manage data models.
  - Reusability: Tables and views defined in CAP CDS can be reused across different applications, promoting consistency and reducing development effort.
  - Flexibility: CAP CDS supports a wide range of data modeling features, including associations, annotations, and constraints, enabling developers to tailor data models to specific requirements.
  - Integration: Tables and views defined in CAP CDS seamlessly integrate with other CAP components, such as services and UIs, facilitating end-to-end application development.

## Working with Tables and Views via CAP CDS:**
  - Define tables using the entity keyword followed by field definitions, data types, and optional annotations.
  - Define views using the view keyword and specify the underlying tables or other views, along with any transformations or calculations.
  - Use annotations such as @title and @description to provide metadata for tables and views, enhancing documentation and usability.
  - Leverage associations to establish relationships between tables, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
