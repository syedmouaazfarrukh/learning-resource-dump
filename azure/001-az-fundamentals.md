- Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
    - Private, Public and Hybrid
    - Multi-Cloud
    - `Azure Arc` (Manages your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.)
    - `Azure VMware Solution` (Already established with VMware in a private cloud environment but want to migrate to a public or hybrid cloud? Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads)
    
## Benefits of Cloud Services

After completing this module, you’ll be able to:

- High availability and scalability in the cloud.
    - Maximum availability, regardless of disruptions
    - Ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
        - Vertical Scaling
        - Horizontal Scaling

- Reliability and predictability in the cloud.
    - Ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
    - Performance predictability or cost predictability.

- Manageability in the cloud.
    - Through a web portal.
    - Using a command line interface.
    - Using `APIs` (These are missing in Azure docs).
    - Using PowerShell.

## Cloud Service Types

- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
    - Maximum amount of control for your cloud resources
    - Use Cases:
        - Lift-and-shift migration
        - Testing and development

- Platform as a service (PaaS).
    - Middle ground between renting space in a datacenter (infrastructure as a service) and paying for a complete and deployed solution (software as a service)
    - Use Cases:
        - Development framework
        - Analytics or business intelligence

- Software as a service (SaaS).
    - Most complete cloud service model from a product perspective
    - Renting or using a fully developed application.
    - Use Cases:
        - Email and messaging.
        - Business productivity applications.
        - Finance and expense tracking.
