# Learning objectives

## Align requirements with cloud types and service models in Azure
- Compare each cloud computing deployment model: public, private, and hybrid.
    - Why Public Cloud
        - Service consumption through on-demand or subscription model
        - No up-front investment in hardware:
        - Automation
        - Geographic dispersion
        - Reduced hardware maintenance
    - Why Private Cloud
        - Pre-existing environment
        - Legacy applications
        - Data sovereignty and security
        - Regulatory compliance / certification
    - Why Hybrid Cloud
        - Existing hardware investment
        - Regulatory requirements
        - Unique operating environment
        - Migration
