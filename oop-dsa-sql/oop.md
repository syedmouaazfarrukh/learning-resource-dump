# OOP

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Classes and Objects: Understanding classes as blueprints for objects, objects as instances of classes.
   - Encapsulation: Understanding data hiding and access specifiers (public, private, protected).
   - Inheritance: Understanding the concept of inheritance and its types (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical).
   - Polymorphism: Understanding compile-time and runtime polymorphism, method overriding and overloading.
   - Abstraction: Understanding abstraction as hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary features.
