# OOP

1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Classes and Objects: Understanding classes as blueprints for objects, objects as instances of classes.
   - Encapsulation: Understanding data hiding and access specifiers (public, private, protected).
   - Inheritance: Understanding the concept of inheritance and its types (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical).
   - Polymorphism: Understanding compile-time and runtime polymorphism, method overriding and overloading.
   - Abstraction: Understanding abstraction as hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary features.

### Learn by example

Classes
blueprint or template for creating objects
It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods)

Objects
Objects are instances of classes.

Encapsulation
Encapsulation refers to bundling the data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data within a single unit
Python, we use access specifiers like public, private, and protected to control the visibility of attributes and methods.

Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another/parent class (superclass). 

Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
 It enables methods to behave differently based on the object they are called on
