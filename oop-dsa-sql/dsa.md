# DSA 

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Arrays and Strings: Understanding operations like searching, sorting, and manipulation.
   - Linked Lists: Types (singly, doubly, circular), operations, and implementations.
   - Stacks and Queues: Concepts, operations (push, pop, enqueue, dequeue), and applications.
   - Trees: Basics of binary trees, binary search trees, traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order), and balancing techniques (AVL trees, Red-Black trees).
   - Graphs: Basics of graphs, representations (adjacency matrix, adjacency list), traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS), and applications.

2. **Algorithms**:
   - Searching Algorithms: Binary search, linear search.
   - Sorting Algorithms: Selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heap sort.
   - Recursion and Backtracking: Understanding the concepts and solving problems using recursion and backtracking techniques.
   - Dynamic Programming: Understanding the concept of dynamic programming, solving problems using memoization and bottom-up approaches.
